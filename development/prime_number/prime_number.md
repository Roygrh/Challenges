# Prime Number Verification

## Problem Statement

Write a function that determines whether a given integer is **prime** or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Requirements:
- The function should take a single integer as input.
- The function should return a boolean value:
  - **`true`** if the number is prime.
  - **`false`** if the number is not prime.

### Example:
- Input: `29`
  - Output: `true`
- Input: `30`
  - Output: `false`

### Constraints:
- Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
