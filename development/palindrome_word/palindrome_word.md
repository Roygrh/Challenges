# Palindrome Check

## Problem Statement

Write a function that determines whether a given word is a **palindrome**. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces and case sensitivity.

### Requirements:
- The function should take a single word as input.
- The function should return a boolean value:
  - **`true`** if the word is a palindrome.
  - **`false`** if the word is not a palindrome.

### Example:
- Input: `madam`
  - Output: `true`
- Input: `hello`
  - Output: `false`

### Constraints:
- The input will consist of a single word.
- You may assume the word will contain only alphabetic characters.
